## 📄 Project Description

This project focuses on classifying driver behaviors to enhance road safety in smart cities and support **Pay-As-You-Drive (PAYD)** insurance services. Using the **SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility)** simulator, we generated a database of simulated driving styles based on the **Intelligent Driver Model (IDM)**. The simulated driving behaviors are categorized into three classes:

- Slow
- Normal
- Dangerous

The simulations were performed on a realistic map of **Miami**, which includes various road types and traffic signs to create realistic driving scenarios. Through **TraCI (Traffic Control Interface)**, we collected detailed vehicle data, including:

- Vehicle trajectories
- Traffic violation alerts (such as speeding, red-light running, etc.)

This data was then used to train and evaluate four machine learning models to classify driver behaviors:

1. **Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
3. **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)**
4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**

The goal of the project is to demonstrate the feasibility of the **AlertDang Driver Profiling** method, which aims to detect risky driving patterns in real-time and support applications such as road safety monitoring and dynamic insurance pricing.

## Deliverables:
- Full source code for simulation, data collection, and machine learning pipelines.
- A labeled dataset of simulated driver behaviors.
- Performance evaluation of the implemented models.
- Discussion of the method’s benefits, current limitations, and possible future improvements.
